            <h3>Georgia State Alumnus with B.S. in Computer Science</h3>
            <p>
              I am a recent graduate from Georgia State University. I earned my
              Bachelor's of Science degree in May 2023. My major was Computer
              Science with a Biology minor. During my college career, I had the
              opportunity to be a part of several clubs. These include
              PantherDev and Programming Club. I also took several classes in
              which I was able to work on and create projects. This website is
              meant to supplement my resume, and also showcase my interests and
              work that are not showcased elsewhere.
              <br />
              <br />
              I am interested in many areas, including biology, healthcare,
              healthcare tech, web development, AI, ML, game development, art,
              and design. I am a dedicated individual; I work hard towards
              learning as much as I can about various topics. My experience has
              allowed me to become very well-rounded, allowing me to fill
              various roles easily. I am hard-working and focused, with great
              organizational, analytical, and leadership skills.
